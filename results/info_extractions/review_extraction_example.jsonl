Still, we get the distinct feeling he has stayed here \nbecause there’s no one back in America who cares if he ever returns. (In a couple of \nelegiac sequences, we see Phillip alone in his apartment, looking out his window and \nwatching the full and happy lives of residents in the building across the way as if he’s \ntaking in a television program. It’s like a sad-sack take on “Rear Window.”) \nWith Hikari and cinematographer Takurô Ishizaka shooting much of the story in \nbright daylight (in contrast to so many night-driven, neon-soaked Tokyo stories), \nPhillip lands a gig with a rental family business run by the brusque and efficient \nShinji, played by Takehiro Hira in a strong performance that reveals surprising layers \nalong the way.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_a87f0413"}
